## Running this:

This project was created with `create-react-app`. Once you have the app cloned, you should run `npm install`. You can then run it with `npm run start`.

### What is this?

This is a repo that houses the base code for a React.js film application. By the final stage of the project, the film app will have a list of all the recent popular movies; a user can scroll through them, click one for more details, and save it to their favorites.
